props => from the child to parent , must go through all steps above
inject and provide => from the parent to the child , the parent can give the child value immediately .
provide for the father and inject for the child 

Note : 
when injecting to the child component, we cannot display it in the parent component 
so , we first set the inject value to value in the data() and call it using this. 

example : 

<template>
<h2> {{username}} </h2>
</template>
<script>
data() {
    return {
        username: 'Abdullah,
    }
}
provide () {       // to be givn to the child component.
    return {
    name : this.username 
    }
} { 
}
</script>
