props => While props depends on a specific parent-child relationship, the Provide/Inject API will inject data into the parent-child tree for any descendant to consume
Note : 
when injecting to the child component, we cannot display it in the parent component 
so , we first set the inject value to value in the data() and call it using this. 

example : 

<template>
<h2> {{username}} </h2>
</template>
<script>
data() {
    return {
        username: 'Abdullah,
    }
}
provide () {       // to be givn to the child component.
    return {
    name : this.username 
    }
} { 
}
</script>



to make communication between child and parent , we use emmits
Example => our child component (popup) 
first , in script block we declare the emmits: ['close'] , 
second , in template block we assign it to an HTML tag <button @click="emit('close')">Close Me </button>
third, in the parent component we make use of it <popup @close="condation" />
in last line , we used our custom event thatr we have created
